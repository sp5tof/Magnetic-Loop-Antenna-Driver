# Magnetic-Loop-Antenna-Driver
Controller is based on Arduino-mini and the multi-turn (1k, 10 rounds) potentiometer connected to.  There is also servo mechanism controlled by three standard lines (power + control line).
LCD HD44780 2Ã—16 is connected to Arduino PINs (12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2). You can use I2C line by modyfing the code. Potentiometer is connected to pin (A0).
The servo control is connected to pin 9.

This code was originally written by Michal Rinott & Scott Fitzgerald.
